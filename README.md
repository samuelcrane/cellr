A dashboard experiment for wine cellars.

If you track your wine cellar using [Cellar Tracker](https://www.cellartracker.com/) then this will enable you to use R to export your data and make some simple visualizations. This is a work in progress, with no specific goals, no roadmap, and no documentation (yet).
